Our model sought to provide a predictive system with which flight travelers could input several features of the flight at arrival, and the model would output the predicted flight delay at the destination in minutes. In our research, we found that we achieved best regression model (by \\\\(MSE\\\\) and \\\\(R^2\\\\) through spark's mllib.regression.LinearRegression model class. This class provides an interface to train an OLS model with optional parameters (regularization, standardization etc.) based on our features."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### What is parallelized multivariate OLS regression?"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, we are attempting to minimize the squared difference between the predicted output of our model and the actual observed values of our dependent variable (in this case flight arrival delay). Here is our loss function, where \\\\(\\theta\\\\) contains our model weights (one for each variable, plus one bias term), \\\\(x_i\\\\) contains independent variable values and \\\\(\\\\) over \\\\(n\\\\) records.\n\n\\\\(f(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{n} * \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left[ \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^T\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\_i - y\\_i\\right]^2\\\\)\n\nAnd through the parital derivative of this loss function with respect to \\\\(\\theta\\\\):\n\n\\\\(f'(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{n}\\,\\sum\\_{i=1}^{n}\\left[ \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^T\\cdot\\mathbf{x}'\\_i - y_i\\right] \\cdot \\mathbf{x}'\\_i\\\\)\n\nAlgebraically, this gives a closed form solution to minimize our loss function (by setting the gradient to 0):\n\n\\\\(\\theta^* = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty\\\\)\n\nHowever, this solution is computationally intractable as \\\\(n\\\\) increases (\\\\(O(n^3)\\\\) time complexity!), and cannot be easily parallelized. The large inverted matrices and associated products cannot be served to individual partitions.\n\nIn Spark, the mllib.regression implementations use various Gradient Descent methodologies to produce parallelizable approaches to estimate the minimum gradient given our list of features and weights. In gradient descent, we descend in our model parameter space in each training cycle or epoch through the following formula:\n\n\\\\(\\theta\\_{\\text{new}} = \\theta\\_{\\text{old}} - \\eta \\cdot \\nabla\\_{\\theta} f(\\theta) \\\\)\n\nWhere \\\\(\\eta\\\\) is a configurable hyperparameter for Gradient Descent learning rate. If properly tuned, we guarantee we will converge to at least a local minimum in our parameter space.\nThis concession to the closed form solution means that we don't have a guarantee of global minimum, but we now can parallelize solutions by sending each record to isolated partitions and calculating their assocaited new gradient compenent, then finally reducing down to a total loss calculation. Each iteration of this map-reduce operation will eventually give us a minimized loss function, in much quicker time than the closed form solution."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### So what's going on in our model?"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Our model uses various flight features as independent variables, with \"arrival delay\" as our dependent \\\\(y\\\\) value.
